          <h2>About Space4</h2>
          <p>
            Space 4 is a co-working and events space in the heart of
            Finsbury Park, giving digital co-operatives and those working
            in positive sectors a space to meet, work and host events.
          </p>

          <p>
            All profit generated from Space 4 goes towards digital
            projects that make the world a fairer place.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please note that unfortunately Space 4 is not wheelchair
            accessible.
          </p>

          <h2>Desks</h2>

          <p>
            Space 4 includes 25 desks, which can be used on a short- or long-term basis.
          </p>

          <p>
            Space 4 is not your run-of-the mill serviced coworking
            space. Instead it is run cooperatively, meaning that
            everyone working here shares responsibility for making it
            a success. This includes promoting the space and the
            people here, organising and attending events and
            maintaining it as a great place to work.
